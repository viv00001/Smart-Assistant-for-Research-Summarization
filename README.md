# 🧠 Smart Assistant for Research Summarization

A GenAI-powered assistant that summarizes long research documents and answers questions from them using **LangChain**, **OpenAI GPT-3.5**, **FAISS**, and **Streamlit**.

---

## 📌 Features

- 📄 Upload **PDF or TXT documents**
- 🧠 Get accurate **summaries (~150 words)**
- ❓ Ask custom **questions** and get **quoted answers with citations**
- ⚡ Powered by **LangChain + OpenAI API**
- 🖥️ Simple, interactive **Streamlit UI**
- 🗃️ Uses **FAISS** for vector storage and retrieval

## ✅ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Smart-Assistant-for-Research-Summarization.git
cd Smart-Assistant-for-Research-Summarization
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up API Key

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxyourkeyherexxxxxx
```

> 🔐 Don’t share your key publicly.

### 4. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

Your browser will open at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Document Loading**
   The app uses `PyPDFLoader` or `TextLoader` to read your file.

2. **Chunking + Embedding**
   The content is split into chunks and embedded using OpenAI embeddings, stored in a **FAISS vector store**.

3. **Summarization**
   Uses LangChain’s `map_reduce` summarization chain to generate a short, meaningful abstract.

4. **Question Answering (RAG)**
   Retrieves relevant chunks using similarity search and passes them as context to GPT‑3.5 via LangChain for accurate, cited answers.
